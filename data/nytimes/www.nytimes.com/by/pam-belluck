<meta property="og:description" content="Pam Belluck is a health and science writer for The New York Times. In 2015, she was one of seven Times staffers awarded the Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Ebola epidemic.
Ms. Belluck writes about many different subjects, often concerning complex or controversial topics, including&#160;hospital delirium, fetal surgery,&#160;end-of-life care, the donation of H.I.V.-infected organs, the science of music and how the morning-after pill really works. Her interests range from head to toe &#8212; from the&#160;&#8220;not tonight dear&#8221;&#160;signal sent by chemicals in women&#8217;s tears to the discovery of the world&#8217;s oldest leather&#160;shoe&#160;(size 7, right foot, preserved for 5,500 years under layers of sheep dung).
Her article about experiments scientists conduct using their&#160;own children as subjects&#160;was selected for &#8220;The Best American Science Writing 2010.&#8221;
Ms. Belluck is also the author of &#8220;Island Practice,&#8221; a true tale about a colorful and contrarian doctor on Nantucket who has performed surgery with scalpels he carved from obsidian, made house calls to a hermit who lived in an underground house and a vine igloo, treated patients ranging from Secretary of State John Kerry to a sheep with a prolapsed uterus and diagnosed everything from tularemia to toe-tourniquet syndrome. The book is in development as a television series.
Ms. Belluck was selected to be a Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton in 2014 and has taught and spoken about science journalism in various venues, including the Santa Fe Science Writing Workshop, the Simons Foundation, the American Association for the Advancement of Science convention and on a Times Journeys voyage to the Galapagos Islands. She has appeared on numerous radio and television news shows, is a member of the TEDMED editorial advisory board and was a cohost at TEDMED 2015.
Ms. Belluck&#8217;s reporting launched The Times&#8217;s Vanishing Mind series about Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and dementia. She traveled to mountain villages outside Medellin, Colombia, and wrote about an extraordinary extended family of 5,000 people, the world&#8217;s largest family to experience Alzheimer&#8217;s. She also wrote about dementia care in South Korea and spent time in a California men&#8217;s prison where first-degree murderers care for inmates with dementia. The series was accompanied by multimedia projects produced with the Times&#8217;s photo, video and digital journalism departments.
In 2014, Ms. Belluck wrote &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Mind,&#8221; a two-part series showing, through months of sensitive, difficult reporting, that maternal mental illness is much more common and varied than previously thought, and that health providers often fail to detect trouble or ensure that women get help.
In 2015, in addition to receiving the Pulitzer Prize, the Ebola coverage was recognized for an Overseas Press Club award and an American Association for the Advancement of Science Kavli Science Journalism award.
Ms. Belluck often writes about neurological and cognitive topics, including memory, emotion and mental health. She also writes about reproductive health issues, ranging from the births of extremely premature babies to efforts to invent a better condom.
While she concentrates on medical subjects, she periodically takes a detour to explore the reasons why women get so cold in air conditioned offices or to chronicle the story of a lost cat that somehow made a 200-mile journey back to its hometown.
Ms. Belluck joined The Times in 1995 as a general assignment reporter on the metropolitan desk, served as the bureau chief in Queens, and briefly covered education in New York City. She was a key member of the team covering the Oklahoma City bombing and the crash of TWA Flight 800.
In 1997, she became the Midwest bureau chief, based in Chicago, covering 11 states. In late 2001, she became the New England bureau chief, based in Boston. As a national bureau chief, she covered some of the biggest news stories including the Rhode Island night club fire that killed 100 people, the introduction of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts and the passage of a landmark Massachusetts health care law." />

        <p>Pam Belluck is a health and science writer for The New York Times. In 2015, she was one of seven Times staffers awarded the Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Ebola epidemic.</p>
<p>Ms. Belluck writes about many different subjects, often concerning complex or controversial topics, including&#160;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/science/21delirium.html?src=me&amp;ref=general">hospital delirium</a>, fetal surgery,&#160;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/health/end-of-life-talks-may-finally-overcome-politics.html">end-of-life care</a>, the donation of H.I.V.-infected organs, the science of music and how the morning-after pill really works. Her interests range from head to toe &#8212; from the&#160;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/science/07tears.html">&#8220;not tonight dear&#8221;</a>&#160;signal sent by chemicals in women&#8217;s tears to the discovery of the world&#8217;s oldest leather&#160;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/science/10shoe.html">shoe</a>&#160;(size 7, right foot, preserved for 5,500 years under layers of sheep dung).</p>
<p>Her article about experiments scientists conduct using their&#160;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/18/science/18kids.html">own children as subjects</a>&#160;was selected for &#8220;The Best American Science Writing 2010.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Belluck is also the author of &#8220;<a href="http://www.islandpracticebook.com/">Island Practice</a>,&#8221; a true tale about a colorful and contrarian doctor on Nantucket who has performed surgery with scalpels he carved from obsidian, made house calls to a hermit who lived in an underground house and a vine igloo, treated patients ranging from Secretary of State John Kerry to a sheep with a prolapsed uterus and diagnosed everything from tularemia to toe-tourniquet syndrome. The book is in development as a television series.</p>
<p>Ms. Belluck was selected to be a Ferris Professor of Journalism at Princeton in 2014 and has taught and spoken about science journalism in various venues, including the Santa Fe Science Writing Workshop, the Simons Foundation, the American Association for the Advancement of Science convention and on a Times Journeys voyage to the Galapagos Islands. She has appeared on numerous radio and television news shows, is a member of the TEDMED editorial advisory board and was a cohost at TEDMED 2015.</p>
<p>Ms. Belluck&#8217;s reporting launched The Times&#8217;s Vanishing Mind series about Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and dementia. She traveled to mountain villages outside Medellin, Colombia, and wrote about an extraordinary extended family of 5,000 people, the world&#8217;s largest family to experience Alzheimer&#8217;s. She also wrote about dementia care in South Korea and spent time in a California men&#8217;s prison where first-degree murderers care for inmates with dementia. The series was accompanied by multimedia projects produced with the Times&#8217;s photo, video and digital journalism departments.</p>
<p>In 2014, Ms. Belluck wrote &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Mind,&#8221; a two-part series showing, through months of sensitive, difficult reporting, that maternal mental illness is much more common and varied than previously thought, and that health providers often fail to detect trouble or ensure that women get help.</p>
<p>In 2015, in addition to receiving the Pulitzer Prize, the Ebola coverage was recognized for an Overseas Press Club award and an American Association for the Advancement of Science Kavli Science Journalism award.</p>
<p>Ms. Belluck often writes about neurological and cognitive topics, including memory, emotion and mental health. She also writes about reproductive health issues, ranging from the births of extremely premature babies to efforts to invent a better condom.</p>
<p>While she concentrates on medical subjects, she periodically takes a detour to explore the reasons why women get so cold in air conditioned offices or to chronicle the story of a lost cat that somehow made a 200-mile journey back to its hometown.</p>
<p>Ms. Belluck joined The Times in 1995 as a general assignment reporter on the metropolitan desk, served as the bureau chief in Queens, and briefly covered education in New York City. She was a key member of the team covering the Oklahoma City bombing and the crash of TWA Flight 800.</p>
<p>In 1997, she became the Midwest bureau chief, based in Chicago, covering 11 states. In late 2001, she became the New England bureau chief, based in Boston. As a national bureau chief, she covered some of the biggest news stories including the Rhode Island night club fire that killed 100 people, the introduction of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts and the passage of a landmark Massachusetts health care law.</p>    </div>
